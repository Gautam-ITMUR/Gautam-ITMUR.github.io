        <h2>Reporting Guidelines and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your safety and well-being are of utmost importance to us. We are committed to providing a secure and confidential platform for reporting bullying incidents within our college community. Before submitting a report, please review the following guidelines and privacy considerations:</p>

        <h3>Privacy Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> All reports will be treated with the utmost confidentiality to the extent permitted by law. Your identity will be protected, especially if you choose to remain anonymous.</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Reporting:</strong> We encourage anonymous reporting. Providing contact information is optional but can be helpful for follow-up if additional information is needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> We have implemented data protection measures to safeguard your personal information and comply with relevant data protection laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Access:</strong> Only authorized personnel, such as our designated reporting officer or team, will have access to submitted reports.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Retaliation:</strong> You will not face any form of retaliation for reporting incidents in good faith.</li>
            <li><strong>Protection for Whistleblowers:</strong> Legal protections are in place for whistleblowers who report bullying incidents.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Truthful Reporting:</strong> Report incidents truthfully and avoid making false or malicious reports, as these can also harm innocent individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> We encourage the submission of evidence, such as screenshots or documents, to support your report. Preserve evidence without altering it.</li>
            <!-- Add more reporting guidelines as needed -->
